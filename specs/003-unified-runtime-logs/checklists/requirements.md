# Specification Quality Checklist: Unified Runtime Logs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-07-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 passed all checklist items on 2026-07-22.
- The requested backend log-ingress endpoint and rotating JSON storage are treated as externally required feature boundaries, without prescribing a framework, library, route path, or internal module design.
- “Keyed pop” is explicitly resolved in the Assumptions section as keyed argument/property preservation; no clarification marker is required.
